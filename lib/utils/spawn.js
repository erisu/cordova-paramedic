/**
 * Wraps the spawn process inside a promise to make it asynchronous.
 *
 * In a successful case, during the on close event, an object will be
 * returned as long as the code equals 0.
 * The object will contain the process's "stdout", "stderr", & "code".
 *
 * If the code is anything but zero, a error object is returned as
 * a rejection. The "stdout", "stderr", & "code" will be appeneded.
 *
 * An error is also returned in cases where the process is errored
 * but not closed.
 *
 * The "options" argument is used for configuring the spawn process.
 * It also takes in the "verbose" and "timeout" settings. These
 * settings will be extracted from options before passed to the spawn
 * process.
 *
 * "verbose" - Determins the level of logging.
 * "timeout" - Determins if the spawn should timeout after Xms.
 *   Value should be set in milliseconds.
 *
 * @param {String} cmd command process (e.g. cordova, adb, xcrun, etc...)
 * @param {Array} args command arguments
 * @param {Object} options Spawn process object, verbose, and timeout settings
 * @returns {Promise<Object|Error>}
